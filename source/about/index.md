I'm a beginner music producer living in Melbourne, Australia.

Recently having a lot of time on my hands I decided to make music for an indie game as one of my lifegoals, so I'm starting up with it.

I'm looking for people starting up in game dev to collaborate with, for now for free, as my experience is none.

If you're looking for music for even the smallest silly project, hit me up on tripovich.txt@gmail.com
