I'm a beginner music producer living in Melbourne, Australia.

Recently having a lot of time on my hands I decided to make music for an indie game as one of my lifegoals, so I'm starting up with it.

I'm looking for people to collaborate with starting up in game dev for free, while I build experience.

If you're looking for music for even the smallest silly project, hit me up on tripovich.txt@gmail.com
